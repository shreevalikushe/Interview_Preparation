    <h3>What are IIFE's?</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Ans:</b> IIFE's are immediately invoked function expression. So, when
      you don't want to store the function in global scope and you only have to
      execute a function once you use IIFE's.

    <h3>What is currying?</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Ans:</b> Currying is an advanced technique of working with functions,
      it basically transforms the function calling from multiple argument
      passing to a sequence of function with single argument.

    <h3>
      Explain some areas where you have seen currying being implemented in React
      / other libraries?
    </h3>
    <p>
      <b>Ans:</b>
      <li>
        Examples of currying are (when clicking a button, the event passed is
        using currying), (how we use props in react).
      </li>
      <li>
        While using redux thunks also currying concept is used, as the action is
        in a function format so from the outer function we pass args to the
        inner function/action
      </li>
    </p>

      Click both the button to see that they both do the same thing but in a
      different way.
